<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Will Australia’s inflation rate fall back to the 2-3% inflation target range in 2025?</p>
<p>Inflation has always been a topic of interest for economists, as trends in the inflation rate provide essential guidance for key decisions by economic participants, thus playing a crucial role in the economic and social development of a country <span class="citation" data-cites="bernoth2021">(<a href="#ref-bernoth2021" role="doc-biblioref">Bernoth and Ider 2021</a>)</span>. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) forecasts that by 2025, inflation will fall back to the target range of 2% to 3% and reach the midpoint of this range by 2026. Influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, Blot et al.&nbsp;deduced that the inflation rate is affected by a variety of factors, such as GDP, exchange rates, interest rates, and unemployment rates <span class="citation" data-cites="EuropeanParliament.2022">(<a href="#ref-EuropeanParliament.2022" role="doc-biblioref">European Parliament. Directorate General for Internal Policies of the Union. 2022</a>)</span>. Therefore, this study will assess the reasonableness of the RBA’s inflation rate forecast for the next two years. During the COVID-19 period, Australia’s inflation rate sharply rose to 7.8%, in response to which the RBA implemented a monetary tightening policy and began raising interest rates at the end of 2022, slowing the pace of rate hikes in the latter half of 2023. Hence, this report will further discuss whether the RBA has correctly assumed that its monetary policy measures have effectively curbed inflation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Direct Inflationary Indicators:</strong></p>
<p>1.<span class="math inline">\(cpi_t\)</span>: Consumer Price Index (CPI) from ABS.</p>
<p>CPI directly measure inflation by follow formula:</p>
<p><span id="eq-1"><span class="math display">\[Inflation  = (\frac{CPI_{Quarter \ of \ These \ Year}}{CPI_{Quarter \ of \ Previous \ Year} } - 1 )\times 100 \tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>CPI is the basic data for measuring inflation. It is more stable and less affected by seasonal factors and short-term fluctuations than the annual inflation rate from which it is derived. In VAR, raw time series data rather than rates of change are used to capture and model the dynamic nature of the data.</p>
<p>2.<span class="math inline">\(infexp_t\)</span>: Business inflation expectations – 3-months ahead from RBA</p>
<p>Inflation expectations often guide consumer and business behavior; if inflation is expected to rise, they might make purchases and raise prices in advance, thus driving actual inflation up in the short term. Meanwhile, central banks closely monitor inflation expectations, adjusting monetary policies to influence these expectations and control actual inflation to maintain price stability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Activity and Policy Indicators:</strong></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(gdp_t\)</span>: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from ABS.</li>
</ol>
<p>GDP reflects the size and growth rate of a country’s economy. When GDP increases, it indicates increased economic activity, which can lead to demand-pull inflation because increased demand may exceed current production capacity, pushing up prices.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(crt_t\)</span>: Cash rate target published by RBA.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the main tool used by the RBA to influence economic activity. Raising the cash rate is usually aimed at reducing borrowing and spending, thereby reducing inflationary pressures.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(unemp_t\)</span>: Unemployment rate from ABS.</li>
</ol>
<p>It indicate the level of slack in the labor market, influencing wage-push inflation.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(m_t\)</span>: Money aggregate (Broad money) from RBA.</li>
</ol>
<p>‘Broad money’ is defined as ‘M3’ plus ‘Other borrowings from private sector by AFIs’. When the growth rate of broad money supply in an economy exceeds the growth rate of its real output, it leads to more money chasing the same amount of goods and services, causing price levels to rise, i.e., inflation. Therefore, central banks like the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) adjust interest rates and other tools to control the growth of broad money to achieve their inflation targets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Market and External Trade Indicators:</strong></p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(export_t\)</span>: International exports from ABS.</li>
</ol>
<p>It affects trade balance and currency strength, influencing imported inflation.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">

<p>It reflects investor confidence and economic activity which can be pre-emptive indicators of inflation.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(exr_t\)</span>: AUD/USD exchange rate from RBA.</li>
</ol>
<p>It affects the price of imports and exports, contributing to inflation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following Table shows the correlation between CPI and other variables.</p>
<p>Despite the low direct correlation between inflation expectations and CPI, inflation expectations may more closely reflect concerns about core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, whereas the CPI includes all items. If the trends between core inflation and overall inflation differ, this discrepancy can reduce the correlation between inflation expectations and the CPI. However, inflation expectations provide additional insight into how future economic conditions are perceived by consumers, businesses, and investors. This forward-looking perspective is important as it might influence economic decisions that are not immediately apparent through current CPI data.</p>
<p>Exchange rate fluctuations are typically sensitive to immediate market sentiment and short-term capital flows, whereas the CPI, as a measure of past price level changes, often exhibits a lag in responding to market changes. Even if the correlation between the CPI and the AUD/USD exchange rate is low, including this variable can help researchers understand economic changes from a broader perspective. For example, changes in the exchange rate can indirectly affect domestic price levels through the cost of imports, especially in open economies.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the unemployment rate exhibits a weak correlation with the CPI. This could be attributed to the Phillips Curve, which illustrates a short-term inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. Over the long term, however, this correlation may diminish due to various influencing factors. For instance, following COVID, the inflation rate in the United States has been continuously rising due to the bankruptcy crisis among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), part of which is attributed to the inadequate supply of export goods produced by SMEs leading to a decline in export volumes, thereby driving up the domestic inflation rate in the US <span class="citation" data-cites="kalemli-ozcan2020">(<a href="#ref-kalemli-ozcan2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kalemli-Ozcan et al. 2020</a>)</span>. This impact can be seen as an indirect effect of rising unemployment rates on inflation. Therefore, despite the weak correlation between unemployment rate and CPI, it is still important to include it in the model for a comprehensive analysis.</p>

<p>In summary, the dataset included data from 1990Q2 to 2023Q4, total 135 observation points with 10 variables.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-transformation">Data Transformation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarterly Transformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All data have been quarterly converted by selecting the data on the last day of the quarter as the observation. One of the reasons for not using monthly data is that high-quality quarterly economic data are more readily available compared to monthly data. In this report, the key data, CPI, which published on ABS, and the monthly data starting point is Q3 of 2017. Since the research wanted to capture longer-term data, quarterly data was considered. Also, policymakers and economists often rely more on quarterly data for decision-making because it provides a more stable and comprehensive view of economic conditions to some extent. This stability is key to understanding and predicting economic trends, especially when considering the long-term impacts of policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log Transformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the line graph of the original data below (Figure 2), we can observe that exponentially growing variables need to be linearized, such as <span class="math inline">\(cpi_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(gdp_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(export_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(import_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(aord_t\)</span>. Therefore, its logarithmically transformed form will be used in the following analysis.</p>

<p>Figure 2 Line plot of original data</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration transformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to ACF plot for all data (Figure 3), we can see all data with autocorrelation. It suggests that the series is not white noise and might not be stationary. In this case, applying a differencing operation, such as a first difference (single-order integration), can help remove the autocorrelation and achieve stationary.</p>

<p>Considering the selection of the order of single-order integration, the unit root test (ADF test) is used and the p value is used to determine its significance. A small p-value means the null hypothesis is rejected (non-stationary).</p>
<p>According to Table 1, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(infexp_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(lm_t\)</span>, require more than first order integration, while other require first-order integration(under 5% level of confidence).</p>

<p>Given that differencing might eliminate some of the long-term information (like trends) within the data, and considering the Minnesota prior method can be effective with nonstationary data, we have opted apply first differencing to all of the data sets.</p>
<p>After logarithmic transformation of part of the data, the line plot of the dataset is as shown below (Figure 4). Even after first order difference processing, the dataset still retains some trend characteristics. For example, almost all variables showed significant changes before and after COVID (the x-aisx is 120).</p>

<p>The model selects ten variables related to Australian inflation. Among the variables most directly related to inflation is inflation and inflation target. Meanwhile, because we use CPI as key variable, we first need to calculate quarterly inflation through CPI. Below we focus on analyzing these two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The actual and expected inflation rates appear to move in tandem over much of the time period, suggesting that expectations may be influenced by current and past inflation rates, or vice versa. At the same time, we see that people’s expectations for inflation are relatively conservative. For example, during the COVID, the expected inflation was around 5%, but the actual inflation later surged to about 7.8%.</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding the specific inflation zone of 2-3%, it appears that both the expected and actual inflation rates oscillate into this range periodically. However, it seems that starting just before 2020, there’s a pronounced peak where expected inflation sharply rises above the actual inflation rate, which then converges back into the 2-3% range shortly after (although actual inflation rate still need some time). So we can foresee that inflation will indeed fall back to the 2-3% range in the near future.</p></li>

<p>Based on the model above, we will employ VAR of order p to carry out forecasts for the next two years. Given that the data is quarterly, setting the forecast horizon (h) to 8 quarters for our iterative forecasting process.</p>
<p>In the forecasting process, we will concentrate on determining the conditional mean and confidence interval of the projected CPI, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(lcpi_{T+h|T}\)</span>. Subsequently, we’ll utilize the forecasted (log) CPI values to calculate the inflation rate and assess whether it aligns with the target inflation range of 2-3%.</p>
